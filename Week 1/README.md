# Welcome to Week 1

So your main goal for this week will be to go through to understand the Multi Armed Bandit problem. The structure of the problem is quite simple to understand, However, it illustrates the common problems that people face when they deal with RL for more general problems as well.

# Reading Material

- Sutton & Barto: Chapter 2
- You can also refer to Chapter 4 of Grokking Deep RL(it covers largely the same material however more elaborately)

# Assignment

Try to implement the algorithms discusssed in the book in the work_on_bandits.ipynb file which is located [here](./work_on_bandits.ipynb).
